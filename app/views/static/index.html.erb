<h3>What is this?</h3>
<p>Glasgow Photo Walk is a structured yet informal walk around the city of Glasgow, requiring just two essentials - a camera and tolerance of rain! The photo walk isn’t restricted to dSLRs, and any level of photographer using any tool – even an iPhone – is encouraged to join us. What will you photograph? Whatever you want! Landscapes, street photography, or even photos of people taking photos. Anything goes.</p>
